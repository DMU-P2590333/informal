       You'll find it easier to read your code, and therefore work with it, if you consistently indent it like this.
       It makes it easier to see the structure visually i.e. what's inside what, and it helps to avoid long lines of code 
       wrapping at inconvenient places.

<p style="margin-right: 250px; margin-left: 250px; text-align: center; font-size:18px">My name is Zoe Steward, I am 20 years old and I live in a small village called Murrow. I went to Neale-Wade Academy for my GCSE’s and my A-levels. When I first started my A-levels I was sitting A-Level Maths, Chemistry and Law, however although I thoroughly enjoyed Maths, the other subjects were not motivating me anymore and they wouldn’t head me in the right direction. After a lot of meetings and conversations I decided to restart the year with different subjects, I wanted to keep doing maths, but unfortunately it clashed with one of my other subjects. I had a much better 2 years at sixth-form once I had changed my courses to IT and Media diplomas. Restarting gave me a completely clean slate. I made loads of new friends and I came close to people I had lost contact with. Once I started looking at universities I was that nervous that I had to make sure everything was right. DMU was the first university I looked at for Media Production  (2017) and I loved the course. I decided that it was the standard I would be comparing every other university to. I wasn’t 100% set on going to DMU yet because the city made me a bit nervous and I thought it might be too close to home. However all the other universities I was looking at were at least 4 hours away or was too expensive to live in (London). I decided around November time that DMU was the university I wanted to go to, so I applied with confidence that I was making the right choice, now it was just down to them for the offer. DMU was my first offer and I couldn’t have been happier to be on the course with some great people. I am now also a course rep, which I never would have done because of my lack of confidence, but being at university, although I have barely been here a month, I feel like a completely different person who has grown so much.</p>

           To create a list, you first need to tell the browser what kind of list you want - ordered or unordered.
           Unordered lists have bullet points. Ordered lists have numbers, letters, or roman numerals.
           You create an ordered list with a <ol> element, an unordered list with <ul>

           You should then put the <li> elements inside the list, like this:
           <ul>
             <li>Reading</li>
             <li>Watching films</li>
